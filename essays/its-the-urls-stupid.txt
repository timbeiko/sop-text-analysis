              Summer of Protocols  Retrofitting the Web




              Technical Note 1








      The problem that I'm trying to solve or at least contribute in some
      small way to a solution has been notoriously hard to articulate
      I've narrowed it down to not one  but three points of departure

        Repairing a medium Hypermedia has been an object of both theory
        and practice for decades preceding the Web and even before
        computers  The Web now ubiquitous traded off a lot of really
        powerful ideas in return for not only easy implementation and
        deployment but also easy  instantaneous  global  publishing
        plus one key capability the others categorically lacked  links
        that cross both system and organizational boundaries  But  there
        is nothing in principle preventing those powerful ideas from
        earlier hypermedia systems real and imagined from being grafted
        back onto the Web  It just needs a clear vision and a little
        elbow grease Kicking off a Jevons Paradox

          If that proposition isn't valuable enough on its face  consider
          the problems early  and proto   hypermedia pioneers were trying
          to solve

            1895  Paul Otlet wanted to organize the world's knowledge 1945
            Vannevar Bush wanted to supercharge individual intellectual
            pursuit 1960  Ted Nelson wanted and still wants  among many
            other things to open up an entire new dimension of creative
            expressivity  and get authors paid for their work 1962
            Douglas Engelbart literally wanted to augment human intellect

          All of these goals are contingent on making it super cheap to
          marshal lots and lots of tiny little pieces of information
          connected to one another by an even bigger number of links
          and this is important links of all different kinds  Compared
          to its predecessors as a specimen of hypermedia  the Web  at
          least out of the box  ranks mediocre to poor  Without help
          the Web is limited in its range of expressivity as a medium
          because the cost of managing tiny pieces densely linked is
          prohibitive  and so it reverts back to the page being the basic
          unit of discourse  Again  nothing in principle prevents this
          from changing  so the question is  what could we make if the
          econophysics of the Web were dramatically altered

        Empowering people  platforms can fend for themselves

          And if that appeal isn't  well  appealing  consider that
          there is an entire class of tools that exist or would exist
          just beyond the reach of a spreadsheet  That is  they do very
          little besides afford data entry into some intricate structure
          or other  do some trivial manipulations  and then represent
          that information back to you or perhaps somebody else  Many of
          the needs for these tools come from professionals in various
          niches often very close the places such tools would be produced
          The overhead  however  is still so high  that they need to wait
          for a vendor to come along and make an app for that Personal
          knowledge management tools are beginning to fill this gap  but
          in my opinion they fail irretrievably in one important way or
          another  One such failure mode is platforms  the integrity of
          your content depends on paying regular tribute to some company
          or other  Notion  Roam  in perpetuity  In systems where you
          own your data  Obsidian  Logseq   its disposition is ad hoc
          In either case  you lose a piece of what makes the Web what it
          is  a set of open standards and protocols that provide a single
          common interface  that doesn't have to be tailored to a single
          vendor  no matter how progressive they turn out to be The idea
          behind this initiative is to set a new floor  where the little
          guy has some bargaining power  not only because they own their
          data  but that data doesn't favour any particular vendor  This
          is about addressing a bottleneck to getting important work
          done as much as it is about addressing a power disparity





        Repairing a Medium The Web left a set of powerful capabilities
        on the table  Let's put them back

      The Web  out of the box  is a system for creating what I
      characterize as sparse hypermedia  long documents pages with few
      links connecting them  If you were to take a typical website and
      strip off the navigation bar and footer  the result may as well
      be a collection of Word documents or PDFs in other words  print
      era documents  In my opinion  one of the main value propositions
      of hypermedia is being able to spare people the need to read  or
      watch  or listen  any more than they have to  You accomplish that
      by breaking up the content into little pieces and making them
      subject to activation by the reader  I call this  by contrast
      dense hypermedia  Dense hypermedia is what we had before the Web
      from Hypercard and StorySpace  all the way back to the experimental
      systems and the original visions of hypermedia pioneers  What these
      systems had in common  though  is that they were all monoliths
      hermetically sealed environments  What the Web did was make
      hypermedia permeable  able to cross administrative boundaries with
      no more effort than it takes to access a local resource  It is also
      characteristically easy to deploy  with the heavy lifting hived
      off to the poles of browser and server  the part in the middle
      instantaneous global publication can be had practically for free
      The Web did these unique and powerful things at the expense of
      capabilities present in its predecessors  as well as introducing
      some problems of its own

        Backlinks On the Web  links go forward only  You can't tell what
        links to a particular resource  That's extra work   This is one
        of Ted Nelson's original beefs with the Web Transclusion and
        the general problem of content reuse On the Web  you can embed
        images  audiovisual content  and even entire other documents
        into a document  and you can reuse scripts and presentation
        information  but you can't seamlessly integrate an arbitrarily
        narrow excerpt from some other source without resorting to one
        of a zillion clunky ad hoc solutions  This leads to a dynamic
        where it's easier to copy information than it is to reference
        it  which in turn leads to additional overhead of keeping said
        content up to date  and the inevitable failures to do so Other
        linking mechanisms left unexplored On the Web  you have arcs
        whether ordinary safe links or state modifying ones  such as
        form submissions   and you have what I characterize as na√Øve
        embeds basically just a rectangle of remote content plunked down
        wherever you put it  In addition to proper  seamless  transclusion
        earlier hypermedia systems had stretchtext  telescopically
        expanding detail   conditional display  e g   Choose Your Own
        Adventure   and view control  different representations of the
        same content   among other interesting and powerful specimens
        of rhetorical  didactic  and literary value left on the table

      Again  the Web can do all these things in principle  and ultimately
      does accomplish many of them in practice   but the solutions are
      ad hoc  one off  and mutually incompatible  We're looking for a
      principled approach to restoring these lost capabilities  so they
      span organizations and implementations  as the Web does with its
      off the shelf repertoire

        It's The URLs  Stupid After decades of experience with this medium
        I conclude that much of what ails the Web can be traced back
        to the inherent tensions around URLs  HTTP URLs were initially
        derived from file paths  File systems themselves come from an era
        when storage was scarce and computers were typically not networked
        As such the naming and locating of computer files a necessary
        precursor to saving anything at all wasn't something one did very
        frequently  and in any case  what you chose to name a given file
        and where you located it  was typically nobody else's business The
        cardinal sin of the Web was to attach public consequences to what
        had until then been a largely private affair  The state of the art
        is that URLs are shamefully unreliable  because there's nothing
        making them be  Link rot  and its subtler relative  content drift
        is so bad  the median survival time of a URL is something like
        three months  Decades into this technology and there's still
        thin  if any meaningful  systematic support for the continuity
        of Web resources and the URLs that identify and locate them

          The Web's inventor is aware of the situation  and tried to
          absolve himself of the issue 25 years ago   Maybe we can
          forgive him  it seemed like a good enough idea at the time

        The tensions I alluded to have to do with diverging interests
        around the content of the URL string beyond its bare technical
        function  For one  URLs are important user interface elements
        they lend themselves to being made intelligible  memorable  even
        guessable and or inferrable  They telegraph information about the
        topological structure of the website  and they provide an entry
        point to the Web from any other  typo graphical medium  URLs are
        therefore potentially valuable symbolic real estate  which gets
        even more valuable as they diffuse out into the environment  The
        tension  precisely  is that choosing a good  intelligible  future
        proof URL takes considerable editorial and curatorial attention
        At the same time  there is demand to pick one quickly  since
        you can't refer to  or even save   the document until it has a URL

          It has been common for some time for URL slugs to be derived
          from document titles  but if you change the title  you change
          the slug or maybe you don't  So then you change the title but
          the URL doesn't change along with it  Again  from a technical
          perspective this doesn't matter  but if you want slugs to track
          titles  something  somewhere has to store that naming history

        The elephant in the room for URL continuity is other people's
        websites  The solution in principle is obvious  you can't trust
        other people's websites so you will have to police every outgoing
        link your website makes to ensure it continues to represent the
        same thing it did when you linked it  This is an easy  if labour
        intensive  engineering problem in theory but a hard design problem
        in practice  so hard I am officially declaring it out of scope
        for this project  I do  however  endeavour for this project to
        demonstrate a model citizen on the Web that is  one you can depend
        on its constituent URLs pointing to the same thing in perpetuity

           ‚ÄâThat is  as long as the domain and Web server  cloud
           lambda  whatever  bills get paid  I have considered what
           happens after the sunset of DNS and single point of hosting
           but the best I am willing to do at the moment is design a
           system that contemplates these possibilities and leaves the
           door open to them  without trying to tackle them directly





        Kicking Off a Jevons Paradox What could we make on top of a
        substrate of dense hypermedia

      The introduction of the spreadsheet contributed to the M&A boom of
      the 1980s  and eliminated an entire class of journeyman accountant
      It achieved this by shrinking the problem of financial scenario
      planning to a point  45 years later  spreadsheets are used for
      everything  they are a veritable Swiss army knife of computing In
      fact  to date  the spreadsheet remains the only viable fully self
      serve programming environment available to the general public  The
      problem is that there is a gulf between what can be accomplished
      with a spreadsheet  and what merits an entire team to be spun up
      to deliver an entire product  The gap is sparsely flecked with
      solutions like R and Jupyter Notebook  but they still require
      learning how to code  Merely knowing how to code isn't enough though
      because of the colossal step change in effort once you exit the
      spreadsheet capability envelope  Many such targets aren't viable
      unless you divert your energy into creating a product  This of
      course is another entire universe of effort on top of what it would
      take to make a tool just for yourself  What this means  in the first
      place  is that a lot of problems simply aren't going to get solved

        I may as well preemptively state my position that I am less
        sanguine about the potential of statistical methods of computing
        than many  Arguments have been floated about the benefits of so
        called generative AI for code  but if you don't understand it
        well enough to write it yourself  how are you going to understand
        it if the machine generates it for you  What makes spreadsheets
        successful is that they are like Duplo blocks  pure functional
        language  batteries included  no messy variables to worry about
        In other words  they are intelligible General purpose programming
        languages have so many degrees of freedom  to say nothing of
        copious housekeeping minutiae  that being able to tell when
        a large language model generates a subtle but consequential
        error will still require a considerable amount of programming
        expertise  You can't trust an LLM for anything that has to be
        genuinely load bearing  and I doubt more parameters will make a
        difference  I do nevertheless believe that there are many roles
        for machine learning in software development  but facilitating
        programming neophytes by magicking up entire production ready
        apps is not on my list

      The most significant advancement in spreadsheets in decades was
      putting them on the Web  That was actually a genuinely good idea
      Same with the implicit version control and collaborative editing
      capability that came along for the ride  That said  I suspect
      people are finally outgrowing the fundamental constraints that
      make a spreadsheet what it is

        The data types are hot garbage  insert joke about Excel trying
        to turn everything into a date there are no composite data
        structures beyond row or column vectors  or otherwise entire
        rectangular regions there are no cycles  nesting  or recursion
        there are limited means of hiding how the sausage is made  like
        you can with the various notebook products and so on


        Consider the following pedestrian example of the limitations
        of a spreadsheet  a humble contact list  one person per row
        Now  suppose some people have more than one address  or even
        simpler  more than one phone number or e mail  To capture these
        values you'll need as many columns for each as the person with
        the most of either  This situation can be palliated somewhat by
        concepts like home phone or work email  but what if somebody has
        more than one job   Or home  for that matter   Contrast with a
        dedicated contacts app  which is record oriented  you can have
        as many phone numbers or e mail addresses  each tagged with its
        respective qualifier  per person as you like

      The existence proof that people want more can be observed in the
      proliferation of general purpose products from AirTable to Notion
      to Roam  to specialized products  bug trackers  CRMs  even tip
      calculators  too numerous to list  I submit that each one of these
      is nevertheless missing at least one piece of the  second  brain
      What makes these products viable is that unlike a spreadsheet
      shaped problem  individuals can't fashion their own solution or if
      they can  their solution is cumbersome enough that they prefer the
      niche product Imagine spreadsheets didn't exist and you needed a
      vendor to show up and make a separate app for every trivial little
      thing you use a spreadsheet for  What I'm arguing is that this
      is in fact the situation  just a little bit farther up a gradient
      of  not complexity per se  but let's call it perhaps intricacy of
      structure  There simply isn't enough software development capacity
      for there to be An App For That   for every that

        Even if there was  the apps would be walled off from one another
        as apps are wont to do  As primitive as spreadsheets are  they
        are at least permeable  the CSV file format is the de facto
        lingua franca of structured data  for some value of the term
        Which is depressing  but at least it's something  Try making
        adapters for every pair of APIs under the sun assuming their
        respective apps even expose them


         DIAGRAM TBD

          Once I figure out how I want to draw this spectrum lookin' thing

            not even worth the trouble of a spreadsheet use a post it or
            calculator or whatever well within spreadsheet rubric at the
            edge of spreadsheet capability envelope  no macros  if you
            are using macros you are Actually Programming can't be done
            with a spreadsheet but worth writing code for assuming you
            can code can't be done with a spreadsheet but categorically
            not worth writing code for worth writing code for  but only
            if you can productize it serious software product need a
            whole team company to support it

          The idea is to move the line of what can be achieved by an
          individual  and is furthermore worth doing  to the right  and
          even fill out the left a little bit


      I posit that if we had  at the core  a way of entering  representing
      and exchanging structured data not to mention its global
      instantaneous publication plus a handful of sundry computations
      we could dramatically extend the capabilities of an individual
      knowledge worker  before they had to touch anything that looked
      like conventional  imperative code  A number of the problems that
      aren't worth solving because they currently require a lot of time
      to program if not spinning up an entire team and company and capital
      to tackle will be within reach  This implies that the companies who
      currently occupy this zone will have to move up the effort gradient
      Some will go the way of those journeyman accountants  Oh well

        To set my argument apart from the current profusion of no code
        low code systems  what I still don't see a lot of again  having
        spent my entire adult life and then some in this industry are
        ways for ordinary people to enter  by hand or programmatically
        arrange  and represent structured data  That is  notwithstanding
        the 45 year old spreadsheet  and all its limitations

      Two decades ago  the media theorist Lev Manovich posited that
      the database by which he meant navigable hypermedia environments
      would be the transformative medium of the 21st century  just
      as film transformed the 20th  I submit that we feel the effects
      of databases on us  like victims ultimately of governments and
      corporations but we still can't afford our own  After 25 years
      immersed in this industry and I showed up late in the game it's
      still a serious project to do anything on a computer that is more
      sophisticated than a spreadsheet  and waiting around for a vendor to
      serve my niche  esoteric needs especially without onerous strings
      attached is a laughable proposition  So what would happen if the
      unit economics of the database or more appropriately  the knowledge
      graph were to get dramatically cheaper




        Empowering People


        Who owns your attention

      there isn't enough software development capacity to do all the
      things  and the capacity that is present extracts a shitton of
      rent i'm basically arguing that the hole between spreadsheet and
      software that genuinely merits a company to be built up around it
      is bad for society gotta talk about the intersection of

        climate change increasing wealth inequality misinformation
        disinformation eroding democracy


        Climate Change While the germ of this project goes all the way
        back to 2006  I got a boost in 2015 when I read Bret Victor's
        sprawling essay on climate change  I was particularly moved by
        the chapter called Media for Understanding Situations  in which he
        argued for the use of models and data in interactive simulations
        to inform public policy discourse  It was enough of a lift for
        Victor to do all he did to make the argument  we shouldn't also
        expect him to figure out how one would pull it off at scale
        although he did put a dent in it  What got me interested was
        that the technical problem of marshalling data and computational
        models and making them available is one I actually know something
        about The complicating factor here is that Bret Victor wrote his
        essay in 2015  when it was still possible to believe that if you
        just gave people good information  they would make good decisions
        That is  before the bullshit renaissance that was in full swing a
        year later  I nevertheless believe the technical problem is still
        worth solving  just perhaps not for the exact original reason


        Increasing Wealth Inequality Climate change is obviously Bad¬Æ
        and We Should Do Something  about it  The We in this case is
        typically shorthand for citizens of democracies  Except our
        governments only do what rich people want  and the things rich
        people want are typically good for them and bad for everybody
        else   Or  if it is any good for us  it's better for them somehow

          You don't have to even posit some grand conspiracy for this
          mechanism  enough of it can be accounted for with boring old
          availability bias  rich people and politicians have a lot of
          access to each other  even if those interactions were completely
          benign In democracies you can think of this as part of the game
          rich people and politicians collude in the gaps  on everything
          that isn't acutely invidious enough to get the latter voted
          out  Sometimes even that isn't enough  in Canada right now we
          have a government in its third term a minority at that pushing
          through bill after bill that nobody  well  somebody  wants  and
          they keep getting re elected because the voters understand the
          other guys would do the same  but worse Presumably how you keep
          this behaviour in check is an engaged citizenry who has a set
          of baseline expectations across the board  and a list of things
          that nobody  regardless of who they vote for  will tolerate

        As wealth inequality sharpens  the dynamics produce a decreasing
        headcount of individuals  each with an increasing quantity of
        resources at their disposal  Everybody else is distracted with
        their own affairs  many of which are economic in nature  Too
        busy putting out fires to do things like participate in civil
        society  Now  when people write on inequality they usually mean
        income inequality and remark about how unfair it is  I'm not
        particularly interested in questions of fairness  rather I view
        extreme wealth inequality  when there are eight billion people
        on the planet and counting  as hazardous to human civilization

           LORENZ CURVE SIMULATION GOES HERE

            I don't love Lorenz curves because they represent perfect
            equality as not only normative but somehow achievable  Perfect
            equality in an economic system is an unstable equilibrium
            that disappears the instant agents start interacting  And
            even if it was somehow stable  perfect equality would amount
            to political gridlock  What you're going to see instead is
            something power law ish  and the question to ask is what
            is the value of the parameter  Represent that as a Gini
            coefficient and the higher number corresponds to fewer people
            in charge of more resources each  which you can interpret
            roughly as how much of other people's attention can one of
            these individuals divert



        My thesis is essentially that people lose resolution as the
        pool of resources under their control increases  as the pile
        gets bigger  they just round off at bigger orders of magnitude
        When individuals are in control of vast quantities of resources
        even the smartest  most well meaning person will make what are
        effectively targeting errors  What we're more likely to get
        though  are people who are not well meaning  nor even especially
        intelligent  This happens irrespective of whether those resources
        are yours  The difference with private wealth is it's your money
        so you're only accountable to yourself

          When you don't have a lot of money  you have to think
          scrupulously about how you allocate every penny  When you have
          more of it  there comes a point and it doesn't take much where
          you can afford to be sloppier  Not only that  you kind of have
          to be sloppier  because if you acted the way you did when you
          didn't have any money  you'd have all this money left over
          and no time to enjoy it  So you allocate bigger and bigger
          chunks at once  Eventually  you hire someone to do that for
          you  and they hire someone  and so on  and that's basically
          the economy in a nutshell

        The reason why I focus on wealth and not income is because wealth
        represents how much of other people's attention you can divert
        at any instant  Income is at best a derivative of that   If you
        want you can think of net  of course income as in the limit what
        you get for your attention and wealth as how much attention you
        can command


        Strategies for getting stupendously wealthy  feel free to mix
        and match

          find some activity that reliably earns you a dollar in profit
          repeat a billion times play a sequence of super convex
          compounding parlays externalize costs and risk  heads I win
          tails you lose  etc own something that enables you to extract
          economic  rent

        Software systems contain these ingredients in unprecedented
        abundance

        When you're poor you can't speculate cause you can't afford to
        lose anything  ever  When you're rich  you can make tons of risky
        bets with huge antes and way way bigger upsides relative to any
        conceivable downside  lose most of them  and still come out on
        top  because and this is true for everybody but it takes being
        rich to really leverage it your adventures only have to pay off
        on average  There's also a huge chunk you can just burn without
        any expectation of return  That means copious vanity projects
        and white elephants  lavish consumption  wild speculative bets
        and unending rivalries with peers  Rocket to Mars  indoor ski
        hill  solid gold toilet  giant limestone pyramid  ultra super
        megayacht  whatever  Do you really want the attitude of the
        people setting the global agenda to be I'll be fine regardless
        of the outcome  so YOLO

        the final remark i'll make before i close this section out is
        wealthy people get a lot of leverage  that only becomes more
        pronounced under conditions of extreme inequality

        human civilization has laboured under much more extreme wealth
        inequality than we see today but that was before the anthropocene
        pick your favourite emperor  they could command entire nations
        but couldn't put a scratch in the planet's ecosystem no matter
        how hard they tried

        climate change is a problem of the modern era basically a side
        effect of us being really successful as a species  of business as
        usual but also a story of people who knew and sold that existence
        to us anyway

        if we want to survive as a civilization we have to evolve new
        ways of organizing and people who do well with the current way
        of organizing are always going to get in the way of that


        The sharpness of the inequality curve is going to track with
        the topology of the economic network  sharper reflects one that
        is more concentrated and centralized  blunter is more peer
        to peer and distributed  A gentler wealth distribution curve
        means the people at the top can't divert as much of everybody
        else's attention for their dumb bullshit  To blunt the curve
        you have to be able to cut these entities out of your economic
        interactions  You have to be able to deny them your attention
        In Bruce Sterling's words  keep more of the money yourself


        Misinformation & Disinformation One evolution in my own thinking
        over the last several years was a Copernican inversion in
        how I conceptualize information  belief  rhetoric  and reason
        okay what exactly do i want to say about this something like
        more information means more misinformation most instances of
        misinformation are barely consequential  people absorb a loss
        that amounts to a minor inconvenience and carry on

           at least the consumers of that information  misinformation
           about a person can be seriously harmful to that person
          so you have a cipolla stupidity area effect there

        corollary  you can believe a lot of wrong shit and it doesn't
        matter ooda loop is not natural  it's something you have to train
        into people aren't looking for facts to integrate into a model
        to make decisions  they're looking for stories that justify what
        they're already motivated to do
         or what they've already done
        okay but what if you actually wanted accurate information
        how would you get it trusted sources  including identifiable
        authors   receipts  full bibliography  tamper resistant  expiry
        date also wait to respond  unless the outcome is worse if you
        don't may need to pay for good information if misinformation is
        sufficiently consequential will need some kind of pricing model
        for that  ie how much is appropriate big thing though is people
        who want good information should be able to get it hypothesis
        is they will outperform the ones who insist on bad information
        albeit subject to certain conditions



        The Erosion of Democracy the whole thing about voters getting
        the governments they deserve

          At this point I should address the well maybe we need to get
          rid of democracy crowd  I submit that democracy is a handbrake
          on the really  really bad outcomes  at least when it functions
          Also note I'm not American  so my experience is different
          from them The point is that there are limitations on what
          individual human beings can address and coordinate around
          Also  if you're holding out for a world order presided over
          by a benevolent AI dictator √† la Culture series  the planet
          will probably be a cinder by then



        How Anything I'm Doing Could Possibly Help i'm not pretending i'm
        saving the world here radically more powerful ways of authoring
        consuming  verifying information radically more powerful ways of
        communicating facts radically more powerful ways of storytelling
         sorry  the information density of substack blows

        XXX THIS IS RIPPED FROM ABOVE SO REWORK IT LOL The problem with
        these niche products is that they are sold as subscriptions  and
        so the intricate memory palaces we create with them are contingent
        on plugging some meter in perpetuity  It would be one thing if
        it was just a matter of money  but there are mounting qualitative
        concerns with SaaS platforms that are becoming apparent as we gain
        more experience with them  To hedge against platforms  we need
        to be able to possess our own data but the data is worthless if
        it can't be used outside the particular platform that disgorged it

          Platforms leaving aside the cornucopia of self dealing
          they engage in with your data have outages and data loss
          incidents  they get hacked  and they go out of business  Or
          they get acquired  and the new owner shuts down the product or
          changes its policy  Or they just change their policy anyway
          to whatever they like  whenever they feel like it  Consider
          how certain platform companies responded to the war in Ukraine
          by denying service to otherwise uninvolved Russians who were
          literally minding their own business  One could argue that's
          an appropriate response  but if some company you depend on
          decides without warning that for whatever geopolitical reason
          they're no longer going to serve you  you're screwed if you
          can't take your business elsewhere





      The problem that I'm trying to solve or at least contribute in some
      small way to a solution has been notoriously hard to articulate
      Some prior art I can draw on for part of  an explanation is the
      independent researcher Bret Victor's 2015 climate change essay
      because climate change is one possible point of departure

        The essay itself is on the order of 12 000 words  and richly
        illustrated with animations and interactive demonstrations
        Victor said he took over two months to write it

      The essay is an exhortation to people trained in various technical
      disciplines  about specific things they can do to address climate
      change  In it is a chapter with the somewhat obscure title
      Media for Understanding Situations  Victor uses as his example
      the situation of public policy discourse where quantities are
      involved and what public policy doesn't involve  at least monetary
      quantities  He remarks that it's possible to use the same data to
      argue either for or against a given policy prescription  simply
      by tweaking some of the variables  The conventional op ed format
      Victor argues  simply doesn't have the bandwidth to communicate this
      nuance  because it has to set the dials somewhere  His solution
      hand said dials over to the audience  so they can determine where
      if at all  is the sweet spot of parameters that intersects plausible
      acceptable  and effective

        Major media outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post
        produce these kinds of interactive features from time to time
        but they tend to be big budget  one off endeavours  Victor is
        calling for this capability to get cheap enough to do everywhere

      This essay was written a year before what can charitably be
      described to use a technical term as a bullshit renaissance  Its
      rise highlights a closely related problem  it is manifestly no
      longer sufficient assuming it ever was to simply give people
      information  though accurate information has scarcely never been
      more necessary  To animate the facts  there needs to be a narrative
      and not every audience either understands or is motivated by
      the same story  A superposition of stories that hopefully all
      draw the same conclusion has to exist all at once  The medium
      for understanding situations therefore has to understand not
      only the situation that needs to be communicated  but also the
      various overlapping constituencies to whom a given situation must
      be communicated  and what their often diverging  if not outright
      conflicting expectations are Climate change  moreover  is a prime
      example of a global  existential  wicked problem

        there is no correct solution  only better and worse ones there
        are numerous stakeholders involved  with diverging  if not
        outright conflicting interests most  if not all solutions will
        have identifiable winners and losers most solutions involve most
        constituencies giving something up there is often disagreement
        about what the problem even is and in the extreme case  whether
        it even exists

      So it is with climate change  there are people who have demonstrated
      that they are perfectly content with the prospect of living on a
      cinder  as long as they're in charge of it

      support communicators to communicate accurate information
      persuasively you don't need accurate information to communicate
      persuasively  but if you're going to claim accuracy you'll need
      to cite your sources and those sources will have to be legitimate

        Arguably a structural basis for the bullshit asymmetry principle
        that bullshit costs an order of magnitude more effort to refute
        than to create stems from the fact that non bullshit has to cite
        and just as if not more importantly  vet its sources Worth noting
        as well that bullshit just got at least another order of magnitude
        cheaper to produce with generative artificial intelligence


      the state of the art of scientific communication sucks basic unit is
      the paper  only just starting to make data available no publication
      conventions for data replication is in the toilet Scientists don't
      need publishers as much as they need a publishing function science
      journalists often misinterpret results

      we can posit a certain category of tool it isn't really a tool as
      much as a thin wrapper around data really just a way to create
      a constellation of small  structured  highly connected chunks
      of information  and navigate around in it plus a handful of ways
      to manipulate how said information is represented plus a handful
      of other operations besides the pulverized bits are addressable
      meaning they can be referenced and reused pkm  tools for thought
      second brain  are in this category add collaboration support and
      message queue task scheduling and you net most groupware  which
      also means  modulo scaling  you net most social networks a big
      subcategory is niche tools for professionals
