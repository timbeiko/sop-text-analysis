Part 1: The Nature of Death
(Some kind of intro including a summary of common views of death[b])
But humans are not the only things that die. Indeed, it seems even non-living things can die. In a reddit thread, When is an MMO considered "dead" to you?[c][d] reddit user u/UnoriginalAnomalies asks, [e]"I'm curious at what point people start actually considering a game "dead". What's your threshold?" (cite). Various users list criteria: when they downsize their staff, when they go free to play, when there are no more updates from the developer, when there is no one at the spawning area. There are related threads, What constitutes a "dead MMO"?, and The Signs: How do you know if an MMO is dying? (cite, cite). Across all three threads, there are ___ replies, many of which offer other criteria, different combinations[f], or counterexamples.
(quick quantitative analysis of the consensus from reddit)
What other things die? Malls, certainly. Myspace is dead. So is LiveJournal and GeoCities. Web2 platforms and social media sites can die. We might also call a party dead - or a music scene[g][h]. An open source code base can die. So can an ecosystem. If we can call these things dead, does it follow that they were alive? Are things made up of the actions of living things, themselves alive?[i] It's not obvious. “What distinguishes an ecosystem from an organism?” and “Are ecosystems ‘alive’ or do they just contain life?” were two of the questions listed at the 2008 International Society for the Systems Sciences Annual Meeting, a research community dedicated to transdisciplinary inquiry into the nature of complex systems – the subject is worthy of serious thought. (cite) There are many famous and controversial examples of things even more questionably on the boundary between living and non-living than ecosystems: At what point is a fetus alive? A virus? etc. But these dead things - MMOs, malls, social media sites – are not biological quandaries. When we say they are dead, we are using the word dead as a metaphor.
Can a protocol die[j][k]? If a protocol lives at all, it lives the way a mall lives – through the activity of participants – and dies by metaphor. What is a general term we can use for these metaphorically-dead things? I propose worlds, [l][m]following the popular concept from Ian Cheng, artist and author of Emissary's Guide to Worlding:
We could say a World is something like a gated garden. A World has borders. A World has laws. A World has values. A World has dysfunction. A World can grow up. A World has members who live in it. A World gives its members permission to act differently than outside of it. A World incentivizes its members to keep it alive, often with the pleasures of its dysfunction. A World counts certain actions inside it as relevant and meaningful. A World undergoes reformations and disruptions. A World has mythic figures. A World is a container for all the possible stories of itself.
A world is what grows on top of a protocol when the protocol lives. (a world has boundaries … cell membrane … coherent behaviour … lifelike, different from life)
What do we mean when [n]refer to something that arguably never lived as dead? [o]Most of these dead worlds in fact still exist. Dead MMOs that are not shut down by the developers in a clear apocalypse event can linger on indefinitely. The mall we call dead has not actually been demolished, and it may still have one or two retailers holding on. I can still log into my livejournal. But nonetheless, they have meaningfully changed state. When we use death as a metaphor, as is often the case with other metaphors, we reveal a truth that is difficult to articulate otherwise: Something is legitimately gone. And much like death in more familiar contexts, it cannot be recovered.[p]
Diagramming the lifecycle of an MMO, we find something like this:

(games[q] which are still active) =>
(games which are referred to as “dead” but have not been shut down) =>
(games which were officially shut down) =>
(games[r] which were officially shut down but there are unofficial ways to play)

Many MMOs which have lost their rich player community, and match the reddit descriptions (______) are more accurately described as in a liminal state between alive and dead - something like protracted dying. Its nature is debatable: one can argue about relative "deadness", or debate different criteria. A game might linger in this liminal state for years, or perhaps be shut down quickly. A similar transition unfolds for many other digital deaths. At some point in the lifecycle, the liminal state of dying ends [s]– in the case of an MMO, this usually looks like the developer going out of business or making the decision to no longer maintain the servers.[t] In general, the end of the dying process takes the shape of a decision, usually undertaken by an authority or marked by ritual.
Following this observation, we will discuss two alternate understandings of death and how they apply in a protocol context. First[u], death-as-a-process: death is not a simple binary transition, instead it is a process (dying) that may result in a protracted liminal state between alive and dead. The nature of this liminal state is debatable – it is sometimes understood as transitional, and characterized by possible disagreement or ontological uncertainty about relative liveness or deadness. The death-process ends with the second key hallmark of death as it will be discussed in this paper: death-as-a-decision. Death is not a given, nor is it a clear natural fact – death is instead a decision, similar to a diagnosis, with domain-specific criteria determined by technology, authority, and culture. We can further separate death-as-a-decision into cases where there is a clear decision-maker, such as an MMO, and cases where there is not, such as a p2p protocol.
Neither death-as-a-process nor death-as-a-decision are unique affordances of digital death. Even in the non-digital context, or cases where death appears to be inarguable or clearly delineated, such as the death of humans, we find many parallels. Not only in the medical profession, but also spanning spiritual understandings, funerary rituals, and the legal system, we find decision-making protocols surrounding death that in many cases allow or even require a lengthy liminal space or process between the world of the living and whatever follows.
In Twice Dead, ____ recounts the changing criteria of human death over the 19th and 20th centuries. In the late _____s, before the invention of ___ and ____ diagnosing death was considered medically difficult. Until ___, some doctors insisted the only inarguable marker of death was putrefaction. This was reflected in public anxiety about being buried alive, such as ____ and _____. (finish example)
Importantly, the nature of these processes as they manifest in the west – including clear consensus around brain death as legitimate death[v], leading to the phenomenon of normalized organ donation from brain dead bodies – are not global universals. In Japan, a country where access to medical technology is certainly as widespread and advanced as the United States, situating the brain ______. Though the brain dead body is an artefact of technology, and it can exist only because of technology, the location of death in the body (or subsequently the location of life) is culturally determined.[w] With current capability,[x][y] a body can continue in brain dead stasis for years. Arguably, and certainly in places where brain death is not considered equivalent to the death of the person, this can be thought of as a protracted death process, or perhaps a liminal state.
Further, in the legal and statutory context, there are many cases where death is understood to exist separately from the death of the body, leading to further and even more protracted liminal states. (Legal death, presumed dead).
In Celebrations of Death, Anthropology of the Mortuary Ritual, anthropologists Peter Metcalf and Richard Huntington use the framework of "rites of passage" to examine death rituals. The term rite of passage was coined by ethnographer Arnold van Gennep, in his 1909 book of the same name, where it is applied to pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, and funerals. He characterizes a rite of passage as being a transition from one state to another, and as having three phases: separation (from the previous state), liminality (being between states) and incorporation (into the new state). Metcalf and Huntington follow this with an extended analysis of cultures where there is secondary processing of the corpse, namely, an initial ritual, followed by a lengthy intermediary period consisting of perhaps years, whereafter the corpse is exhumed and a further ritual concludes the funeral process. Secondary processing is also common in _____. (Toraja, finish example) Though these examples may seem isolated, they also represent edge cases that may have more in common with rites familiar to the western reader, for example, christian purgatory, the _____. or ______. 
This is not to mention the most clear case where death is a decision: suicide and relatedly euthanasia[z]. (________) But the most salient point on the matter of death-as-a-decision is that death is always already a decision.
Another example where death is poignantly a personal decision, but simultaneously used as a metaphor, is the dead name[aa]. (________) A world may not be a living thing, but a living thing can be a world. Or to borrow language again from Ian Cheng, "These days it’s hard to see a person as a person in the classical sense. Better to think of a person as a world grown on the substrate of a biological body. A World of You."
Once we name death-as-a-decision, like a magic word the curtain draws back and the decision-maker appears. Who has been given authority to decide that something is dead, and what rituals or protocols are undertaken to cement its deadness? In the human context, it is doctors, lawyers, and sometimes religious authorities. In the context of worlds, it is ______.
There are of course also dead blockchains and dead smart contract protocols. The particular nature of p2p protocols means the end state that gives the most clarity - all servers shut down by the developers, unpingable, no nodes alive - is very rarely reached. There is no clear decision maker who could turn off the server, and indeed no single server. This decentralization is the source of some desirable properties, such as censorship resistance and ability to persist even in the face of takedown attempts by well-resourced actors. (Vitalik warlock story). Nonetheless, we could define a series of death criteria and make a diagnosis. In a report on the subject, Coinmarketcap suggests projects with negligible trading volume, joke projects, and projects with little to no funding are dead (cite). Coinopsy.com maintains a list of dead coins, even offering a 0.1 ETH reward for new death reports (cite). It has four criteria[ab][ac] for being instantly added to the list: Ranked below 1000* for over 3 months (unspecified where, possibly on its other ranking pages), Volume under $1000 USD for 3 months, Website dead and no trace of updates, and No nodes or other similar problems. As of June 2023, there are 2439 coins on its list, going back as far as 2011 (cite). 99Bitcoins' page for dead coins, formerly deadcoins.com, maintains a list of more than 1700 blockchains that have died and for each one gives a series of "death indicators" including: Inactive Twitter, Low Volume, Not indexed, Not Listed on exchanges, and Website Down (cite). I would propose additionally: transaction volume, difficulty of attacking the consensus system, and (______?????)
In cases where there is a clear decision-making authority on the matter of death, such as a company that administers an MMO, we can find that a world has a legitimate funeral moment. In 2008, Electronic Arts decided to shut down the servers of The Sims Online, a multiplayer version of the classic single player simulator—essentially sending the entire world and all of its community members to a scheduled apocalypse. Released in 2002, the game had never seen the success EA had hoped for, and after a rebrand in 2007 as EA-Land the shutdown was announced for 2008. (cite) In the final minutes of the game, players gathered in the town hall to attend a See You Soon Party, where one of the community members gave an emotional final speech:
I just wanna thank you all, it’s been an amazing experience, it really has, and I told myself I wouldn’t make myself cry, but I can’t stress enough how much you guys have meant to me over the past, oh however many years it’s been. It really has been awesome and uh, some people don’t get attached to things but when you make friends the way people have in this game, it’s actually really hard. (cite)
Another example is Asheron’s Call, which ran from 1999 to 2017. The game had a strong and dedicated community of players, but it had shrunk over the 17 years and was no longer profitable. (cite) In a video documenting the final moments, as player avatars disappear in waves, each death marked by a purple spiral, one streamer says through tears:
Don’t let Dereth go to waste. And all these people and all their items. And everything that we’ve worked for, the friendships, and the relationships, and the marriages and the kids and the friends and everything that people have had. Don’t let this go to waste. Thank you everyone. (cite)
Moreover, in these moments of grief we can see clearly[ad]—perhaps more than at any other time—what characterizes the life of these worlds. While we casually say “irl” when we mean “in real life” and not on the computer, these digital worlds have always been real in the Philip K. Dick sense: “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.” (cite) Like Margery Williams’ classic children’s story, The Velveteen Rabbit, about a toy that becomes real, they have been loved into a kind of transubstantiation:
‘Real isn't how you are made,' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.’
'Does it hurt?' asked the Rabbit.
'Sometimes,' said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. (cite)
The emotional investment and the participation of living beings that inhabit a world is not obviously quantified or measured, but it too has reality – and this is not unique to games. The first marriage vows were enshrined on a blockchain in 2014 by David and Joyce Mondrous. (cite) One of the contenders for “first NFT” is OLGA, minted on the counterparty blockchain by JP Janssen, also in 2014. The image is a drawing of Janssen and his now wife and is titled “Моя Вечная One & Only” which translates to “My Eternal One & Only.” (cite) In 2015, Terra Nullius, an early project on the Ethereum network that allowed people to record a short message, hosted a memorial message to Nóirín Plunkett, an open source contributor and VP of the Apache Software Foundation. (cite, cite) More recently, a smart contract was deployed to serve as a memorial for coronavirus whistleblower Dr. Wenliang Li. (cite)
It may be that there is an inverse rite of passage and liminal state preceding the life that in turn precedes death of these worlds.
The participation that is key to bringing a protocol (ethereum) into a world is why I suggest transaction volume and difficulty of attacking the consensus layer as key metrics - both gauge participation in the protocol outside of economic metrics.
These moments are possible because the death-decision has been made. The companies that ran these games clearly possess the authority to decide. This is one of the strengths and weaknesses of a centralized system. The exact strength that makes a decentralized system or protocol resilient to attack is [ae]the same one that makes[af] it resilient to a death decision[ag], or lacking a death decider. Grief is useful – not only for emotional processing, but for archiving.[ah]


Part 2: Death and the Archive
To think about death in a digital context is inevitably to consider the archive. [ai]Most of the worlds we have looked at closely exist online – and it may be that the online context is uniquely suited to worlding. Certainly, the starting-cost-to-world ratio is lower there than in physical space. The online context also uniquely lends itself to the question of archiving[aj].
What kind of archive, cemetery, or memorial, is appropriate for these dead worlds? The first impulse might be to store all of the data that encompasses the world. In the game context, that would mean the game save file, the data of the map and all of its buildings. One could also store the game code, the game engine, even the operating system the game runs on, and the drivers for common hardware. We could store every version of the world that exists, for every tick in game time, so that we could replay deterministically every move that every character made with every game item—in fact, in our attempt at constructing an archive for a digital world, we could reinvent a blockchain from first principles. But what would we have actually captured what matters about the world?[ak]
In the Preserving Virtual Worlds Report, part of a collaborative research endeavor between Lindon Labs, the creators of Second Life, and several North American universities, the authors write:
An important part of the historical context for virtual world history is the fact that human beings (through their avatars) fill these digital environments with meaning that emerges from their activities in social spaces, regardless of whether the spaces are synthetic (digital) or physical. (cite)
Furthermore, “If we save every bit of a virtual world, its software and the data associated with it and stored on its servers, it may still be the case that we have completely lost the history.” (cite) They call this the fantasy of perfect capture: While we can back up the data that encompasses a game map, all the buildings that inhabit it, even the engine that runs it, none of these acts in fact captures what it really is. A world, much like a protocol, cannot exist in a static instant. A protocol must be enacted, and a world must be lived in.[al]
The Arctic Code Vault epitomizes this fantasy of perfect capture.[am][an] It is a ______. It contains _____. Unfortunately, the premise of storing this code in this way is completely unvalidated – even farcical. Who wrote this code and why? What did they use it for? The mistake being made is to equate the "meaning" of this code, with the code itself. Much like the game save state in an MMO, there is something fundamental about the life of an open source software project (both in terms of contributors, and users) that is absent.

(museums[ao] and permanence/immortality)

If all technology is, as has been often claimed, an extension of the body – is the endgame of all technology, ultimately, immortality?


A blockchain in particular makes a certain kind of claim about time and permanence: that it is ongoing, that it is unidirectional, that the past is immutable, that it is singular.


(the internet archive)

It's useful to contrast an archive with a memorial[ap]. With an archive, the fantasy of recreating the thing being archived potentially exists – if not literally the thing itself or the original document. No such pretense persists with the memorial. Instead, perhaps it exists as a testament to what cannot be archived. A memorial is a kind of compression technology[aq]: We make memorials when there is something uncapturable, too big, or that should be made to stand in for a larger symbolic meaning.


(some example memorials[ar][as], maybe the memorial against fascism)
The thing that dies is the thing that cannot be archived[at][au]. Only by understanding this will we be able to construct useful archives[av][aw] – and for what cannot be archived, to grieve
What digital processes aid grief? (second death, grief tech[ax])
Does the archive only grow? In both a personal and cultural context, we are all amassing archives accidentally and constantly. By _____ Facebook's databases will contain more dead people than living ones. Even in ___, Vannevar Bush, theorizer of the memex, complained of the __________. (cancers, life/systems analogy?)
In a paper called The Art of Forgetting[ay], Tomas Zahora discusses Agrippa and the medieval technology of memory. (explain this). Alongside this art of memory, was a less-discussed art of forgetting – undertaken when memory palaces had overgrown their usefulness or needed to be renovated. In other words how "a culture dependent on complex mnemonic systems handled an excess of remembered material" (cite). Techniques can be as literal as visualizing a wing of the palace being destroyed, or ___. This is aligned with some contemporary findings about memory. For example … (If you negate, you may forget). Zahora considers that the art of forgetting may have become particularly urgent in the era of Agrippa's writing, year ____, because it was a time of profound cultural change.[az] He writes,
Does it mean that in times of paradigmatic change our minds are stuck with outdated mnemonic frameworks amassed during years of study and subsequent practice? What happens when a whole mode of learning shows signs of stress? (cite)

[a]This title is quite (and delightfully!) provocative. At a minimum, it seems to be in opposition to the life extension suddenly rich tech entrepreneurs have been fixated upon. I, for one, cherish the knowledge that I am impermanent and will eventually be altogether forgotten, so maybe I'm reading too much into this, but if this is an intended theme, it could be made more explicit in your analysis throughout.
[b]I was reading your essay and it reminded me of "this place is dead anyway" from the movie Swingers I think

[c]Vitality is in the eye of the beholder
[d]Could add here that later versions of this draft probably need to briefly note what an MMO world is, if say an older reader came across this who wasn't immediately aware.
[e]Love the cold opening in a Reddit thread 😀
[f]In writing about identity, especially online, there's a concept of "relativity" -- and maybe, death online also inherits that relativity. Yes, we have the same IRL but I think it's far more consistent than in digital spaces and abstract concepts.
[g]It's interesting to me that all of the most vivid examples of something that has died involve a residual part of the thing that continues to exist. Maybe if something completely vanishes it is more likely to be forgotten altogether rather than considered dead.
[h]Ok you get to this below but I'll leave the comment up lol
[i]In Saving Time, Jenny Odell argues that aliveness is much more about negotiating/adapting one's existence with time (entropy) — this may be a good reference for defining aliveness for your article, too.

[r]Could be cool to include "zombie mode" type of transition, when it is revived by a fanbase later on in a new form. Maybe reincarnated is a better name.
[s]This called to mind the sentiment of "you die twice--bodily first, and then again the last time someone remembers you" 


Do digital worlds experience death when they lack attention, do they experience a rebirth when they are stumbled upon again (by...a human OR a bot??)
[t]Why is game death a supply-side process? 


Do users/players just not have sufficient ability to make decisions?
[u]Reminded of “meditation is the art of conscious dying”
[v]The Yale research on reviving portions of pig brains after death might be a further development slightly challenging this consensus, which some readers might be aware of: https://news.yale.edu/2019/04/17/scientists-restore-some-functions-pigs-brain-hours-after-death Though the outcome of the research was still limited, and I may have come across some criticisms of it which I forget the details of offhand.
[w]Fascinating
[x]I read somewhere (IIRC) about certain approaches for restarting the heart etc. being a relatively recent 20th century invention which changed the older meanings of death. It may have been in the context of reading about near-death experiences - I think I read something (this should be double-checked) that they're a more common experience in modern times now that we have more ways to revive people from certain physiological conditions.
[y](Here's one article I came across in a quick search which seems to talk about their history as a relatively recent scientific concept, from what I saw quickly skimming it: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-near-death-experiences-reveal-about-the-brain/)
[z]Canada MAID program? https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/ad-am/bk-di.html
[aa]Makes me think about various interpretations of queerness in the metaverse -- how do digital identities enable multiple lives/deaths?
[ab]Do you know if these criteria have changed over time? Similar to how human death criteria have
[ac]Good question - I don't know if they have (especially on this site) but it would be interesting to try and find out
[ad]Something worth exploring might be the distinct ways in which different cultures grieve or celebrate death. The relationship between death and beauty has long fascinated me. At a minimum, many of life's most cherished moments are finite, such that I see an inherent link between our own mortality and many of the experiences I most cherish. Freshly cooked food, a perfectly pulled cappuccino, and a fine bottle of wine all fade rapidly due to their best aspects relying on fundamentally impermanent chemical compounds. A keurig is not an exquisite coffee experience, and never will be. Even the euphemism "le petit mort" evokes the concept of death to refer to the exquisite. 


That being said, there's an odd tension here, for having witnessed death, I have never found it beautiful, whether violent and sudden or peaceful and elderly.
[ae]This idea of decentralized systems lacking a death decider makes me think of religions as kind of a cross between a centralized and a decentralized protocol system. People can keep practicing their religion even if the central authority (e.g., the Pope) says it's dead, but I guess they would be doing it in an 'unofficial' 'less legitimate' sense.
[af]I'm not sure if this is the intent but this almost makes me feel sad. What would happen to the couple who put their marriage vows on the blockchain, etc., if these protocols die without room for any grief? 


I find myself wondering: what does good protocol death look like?
[ag]but they are not immortal. Which is cool to think about.
[ah]🔥
[ai]I think I mentioned this before, but I strongly feel like this paper would benefit from mentioning the concept of the death of authorship, since I found myself repeatedly compelled to look for it to be mentioned throughout my time reading. It would be especially interesting to consider in the context of game worlds, since they might challenge the typical “death of the author argument” of an audience outliving and re-interprets an author’s work by involving situations where both an author and an audience would “die.”
[aj]Isn't memory (per Kei's project) an intrinsic form of archiving in the analog realm?
[ak]🔥🔥
[al]so good — a protocol is alive
[am]This is going to stick with me - such a succinct expression of the problem
[an]so many digital preservation projects in archaeology suffer from this delusion
[ao]This line makes me also think about the concept of a "living museum," ie. when something like a ship or a farm is preserved in an operational state instead of being a static archive. Or a "living memorial," though I feel like those necessarily become less precise in implementation.
[ap]Funerals are declining (at least in US society recently). I tried to find similar data on monuments, but given the recent focus on confederate statues, couldn't find anything apart from number of those monuments still standing v. those taken down. If I had to guess, I would say we're also erecting less monuments over time. Are memorials therefore becoming less common? Does this time trend tell us anything interesting about society currently versus one that produced more memorials?
[aq]🔥
[ar]rachel whiteread's holocaust memorial in vienna is a beautiful example -- it's a sort of inverted library where the books spines' are not front-facing, evoking the impossibility of accessing that (those lives) which has been lost forever 
good photos here: https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/designing-for-typologies/a2623-judenplatz-holocaust-memorial-by-rachel-whiteread-a-plethora-of-signs/
[as]Day of the Dead seems like an angle on memorializing as an interactive process which would be relevant to include; I feel like it's something many American readers have already heard of a little bit while still being foreign and unfamiliar.
[at]I'm curious to understand this better. just to poke it a bit further: museums regularly archive and collect human remains for example. isn't a mummy is something that died and has been archived?
[au]I would say instead that the "person" or human being is what has died, and the thing that can be archived (the mummy, the person's belongings, associated artifacts, etc) is not really equivalent
[av]i want to hear more about this! and what makes a useful archive with this context of things that should be left in their graves
[aw]very good question - I don't think it's articulated clearly anywhere in here, but I think it's related to the section on the arctic code vault (the meaning of the code is not in the code) ... as in, a more useful archive of something like an MMO or blockchain would try to capture the things not present directly in the game/blockchain itself that were nonetheless central to it's meaning, and this would probably be involve something more like history-writing or storytelling than a game save file or copy of the blockchain itself

[ay]Right to be forgotten?  https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/
[az]This is a great thought. The Art of Grieving / Moving On / Letting Go... the urgency of these things is a function of how much things are changing.


On the one hand, it is an important art in cyberspace, as often things you used to know get lost in the flood of information. So there are more times when being able to forget is useful. On the other, maybe it's less and less often that we lose things online. This makes the art of forgetting a rarely practiced skill, which results in digital loss being surprisingly traumatic.


On a related note, the concept of Search/View/Watch Histories on various apps is something we don't have IRL, unless perhaps one keeps a daily journal.
[ba]This whole essay has an appropriately ethereal, dreamy vibe like it was written by a ghost almost who is not aware there is a reader in the room :) It almost feels intrusive to read it. I like it though. You can either lean into this vibe or make it more self-conscious of the reader and speak to them. The flow feels natural where I get the references but a little obscure where I don’t. I’m not a gamer, so some assistance over those parts would help. But overall a really original wander through an unusual topic with unexpected blockchain insights. Speaking explicitly to ossification might be interesting. Do the mortuary cultures of Ethereum and Bitcoin differ? How? One thing I’d suggest you *dont* change is the slight sense of wildness in this essay compared to the others. That’s valuable. I’d try to retain that feel as you polish and finish.
[bb]i really love the meandering of this essay and the provocations it makes throughout. I think I'm left wondering how do i attend to the worlds i care about (whether that means active maintenance of their life or making the death decision and hosting an appropriate rite of passage). this question of how to determine whether to maintain (and the work involved in that, the preservation of life) or to kill when it can stem from the same care of the world lingers
